# gexchange
gex, is simple #python tool of mine, which is a #webscraper as it uses google search to show you currency exchange rates of any currencies of the world including cryptocurrencies. ðŸ”¥
Moreover, you don't need to remember the currency names, as it infers the currency from the given country name.
